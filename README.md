##Gitinspector
Could not find a way to make gitinspector work and as such we refer to the insights page of the github page where you will find information regarding productivity.
We would however like to state that all members have paticipated and provided value during the project with no exceptions. Adam and Ebu have conducted pair programming
for most of the course so this should be kept in mind. Christoffer and Tors lines of added code being so high is due to errors we made when working with Github and pushing initial commits.

##Structure:
  - Install and execute guide in VisualStudio2019_Installation_Instructions.pdf
