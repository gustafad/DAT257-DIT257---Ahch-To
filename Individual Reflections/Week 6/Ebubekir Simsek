What do I want to learn or understand better?
I believe that I have accomplished my goals from last week thus I know how to sort a list of vehicles in the easiest and most effective way now, 
besides that I feel more confident regarding making estimation time for a user story. For the next week, I want to learn more about how to make the 
final steps before handing in the project to the ‘client’. To accomplish this goal, I will need to do research and talk with my group members about this subject.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We are getting closer to our deadline for this project and of course we have been in situations where someone in the group needed help including I. 
As a group we have always tried to be active in our communication platform and be available for questions and discussions as well. 
The only way I personally can think of helping the team is by sharing my experience and the resources I have about the particular topic that is actual

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Overall, I have tried to figure out more about Team Retrospective and find a nice template to follow and fill in each week for the group.
Usually, we have always done this reflection orally but have not taken any real notes. Further on, I believe that this template will help us take
notes and have overall a structure on it.  

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week, I have been working on redesigning the frontend part of our webpage. Since Adam and I learned a lot from each other last week, 
we decided to work together in this part as well. We tried to make an easy and nice view of the list and filtration field. 
I could say that I am really satisfied and proud with the results we have achieved as a group so far in our project.
