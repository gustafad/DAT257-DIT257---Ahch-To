What do I want to learn or understand better?
I believe I have successfully followed the same path of learning that I wanted
to achieve from last week(A). Since it has come to the last parts of the project
I wish to learn more of how we should take action regarding the final sprint and
what that would entail.(B) This will come in time(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As we are as close as one could get to a MVP, I feel like I have spread my
knowledge as much as it would be needed. The other team members have been very
efficient in learning how to work with MVC and html and I wish to continue
to be able to answer any question that I may have the answer to.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As most weeks, I have now been allocated as a general member of scrum. And with
the amount of times that I have done this, I could confidently say that I feel
comfortable in these shoes in regards to that I can efficently do my tasks. Since
we barely have anymore tasks left to do regarding userstories, I again do not have
a clear goal of what I wish to achieve. Just continue to learn and experience to
gain knowledge.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Me and Ebu worked together once more, and this time we did more efficently distribute
the tasks that we had been alocated. We learned how to better work in paralell.
This I belive worked well and if we work together again, we should continue that flow.
