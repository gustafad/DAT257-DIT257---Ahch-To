What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since this is the first week there are a lot of things I do not know and understand(A).
I want to better understand the scope and purpose of the course, and to develop my social & team working skillz(B).
The weekly meetings and general team-working will probably do this for me(A->B).

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Before this week i can’t remember that i’ve met any of my teammates(A).
I have my personal point of view and experience and i hope to share this with my team(B).
I believe that this will happen organically during the duration of the course(A->B).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My current knowledge of Scrum is barely existing at all(A). 
I want to be able to answer this question better(B), and I’m sure i will be able to soon, through information from the course(A->B).

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Right now my contribution is minimal(A). I hope that it’ll be useful and at least proportionate to the other team members(B). 
Exactly what it’ll be and how will be more clear as soon as the project gets going(A->B).
