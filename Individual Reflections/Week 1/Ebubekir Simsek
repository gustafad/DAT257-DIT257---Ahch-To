What do I want to learn or understand better?
It is my first reflection here and currently I don’t have much material to reflect over (A), 
but I wish to learn more about how a team properly works with Scrum in a project and see the advantages of it (B). 
I believe that we should see the differences with time during the course working with Scrum in relation to not working with Scrum (A->B). 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As stated above, we haven’t faced difficulties yet as a group but I believe the time is close :D. 
However, if I have the opportunity and the knowledge to help someone or the entire team that has a problem(A), 
I would try to solve the case and help them out (B) by sharing my experiences and knowledge about the case(A->B).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Right now (A) I feel that Scrum would be a perfect medium for us to work within the group, 
otherwise it can be hard to make the group work sustainably. 
We should strive for a Scrum that works properly for the group(B). 
What I can contribute towards the team’s use of Scrum is basically to respect the Scrum's rules and behave as it asks for (A->B).   

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
So far, we haven’t done any deliveries(A). If we in the group decide to share the work, 
then it is my responsibility to make sure that my work is done before the deadline(B).
I can always come with improvements and strive for a better result for the group (A->B).
