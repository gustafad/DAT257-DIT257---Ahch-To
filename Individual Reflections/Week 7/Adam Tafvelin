What do I want to learn or understand better?
Everything has been going to plan and I believe I am still on the right track.(A) For next week we will do the final hand in. For this I wish to learn more about that process(B). I will spend some time learning about it beforehand.(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Again this point will be very similar to the previous one. The only difference is that we are right now done with the MVP.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week I was again a general person in the scrum team. And again it all seems to go smoothly.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I worked together with Ebu to add an indicator of how many cars should be shown, and let the user decide that number. The reflection is the same as the previous week, everything is going smoothly.

NOTE: I feel these individual reflections are quite repetitive. Towards the end there is almost nothing new to write as we have gotten into a good spiral of how to manage the project and our responsibilities. I would suggest changing the questions for each week so we can have something different to write about.
