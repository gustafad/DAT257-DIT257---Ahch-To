What do I want to learn or understand better?

Everything has been very good this week as well and I believe that we still are on the right road to the final deadline. For next week, 
I want to learn more about how we should work in our final report and the content of it more specifically. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Again this point, the only way I personally can think of helping the team is by sharing my experience and the resources I have about the particular topic 
that is actual. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I am really enjoying working with the methodology scrum and really believe in their pros. Therefore I am always trying to come up with new ideas to 
improve our work as a group

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week, I have been working on a feature where the user should be able to decide how many items to be shown in the list. 
Since Adam and I learned a lot from each other last week, we decided to work together in this part as well. I could say that I am really satisfied and proud with the results we have achieved as a group so far in our project.
