What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to familiar myself with how C# works since we are going to use it in our project. I also want to repeat my knowledge in languages such as html and css so that I can improve on work with it in the next sprint and contribute to the team.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since, I have some experiences and knowledge about working with web-application and API in my past projects, hopefully I will be able to help my teammates with some questions and problems that appear. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week, we began to work with Trello. I contributed with our backlogs, user stories and team reflection for this week.  

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We spent this week both doing our setup for the framework that we shall use and some basic user stories. I started to work with the front page too, thus we as a time splitted up user stories to work with. I spent time making a logo for the team as well.
