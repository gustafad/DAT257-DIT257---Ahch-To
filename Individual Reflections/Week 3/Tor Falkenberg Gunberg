What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since I’ve been working on the application this week my understanding of html and Visual Studio has expanded greatly(A).
But I need to understand it much better to feel comfortable. Also still have not done any C# coding(B).
For next week's sprint I will do more deliverables and familiarize myself even more with the IDE and programming languages(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week has consisted of a lot of learning for my part, with the new coding languages and all(A). 
I have been very busy with family matters, and hope to be able to contribute much more(B) next week (A->B)!

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Each of us converted some parts of the program functionalities to user stories at the beginning of the week, 
effort estimated them, and chose which ones to complete. I did my part, although at the very end of the week, 
because of family matters(A). 
I wish to be more active the following sprint and contribute more(B). 
Next sprint I will allocate more of my time towards the meetings(A->B). 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I put together and designed the application's secondary page, with information about the idea, 
and reasoning about why choosing an environmentally sound car is important(A). 
Next week much more progress will be made(B). We will have the full sprint to work on deliveries, 
as compared to only half a sprint this week(A->B).
