What do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently we have nothing true to reflect upon (A), however I do wish to understand and get to 
know my team-members better and get a better overview of what I can expect from them and what they can 
expect from me (B). This should come with time and the more we interact with each other, planned meetings 
and working on something together should be enough for this (A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We again don't have much to base off of (A), though being able to help my team members with what I can 
and share my knowledge (B) can be achived quite easily by generally being available to discuss and 
answer questions on Discord (A->B).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We are still very new to Scrum (at least I) (A), but I do wish to be useful in that regard (B) and respect 
the rules of which Scrum provides (A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As we have not done any projects as of yet (A) I cannot say for sure, but I do wish to contribute an equal 
and fair amount of work that is submitted before the deadline (B), using a planner for this 
should prove useful (A->B)
