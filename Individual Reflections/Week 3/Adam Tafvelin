What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have learned a lot more about how the documentation and back end of scrum(A) I wish to keep this up as 
to improve and be more helpful towards my team!(B) I had been sick this week and my brain was quite saucy
meaning my preformace was lacking. With me feeling better I believe to be able to deliver more(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As of this week, my knowledge of css, html, and c# has been somewhat useful to the entire group. Though
the absolute majority of the times, they have managed well by themselves. I have only been there if they
have some questions(A). I again wish for my experience to still be useful the coming weeks for the group(B)
And being available and communicating with my group should be enough to enforce this(A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have communicated well in regards to our use of Scrum and our use of the backlog with trello has been
very effective and nice to work with. Sadly we were not able to make our deliverables until Wednesday,
thus our planning was slightly off, making scrum harder to follow(A). Me being a general member of our scrum
team, there was not anything special that I specifically did, that I do wish was different.(B) This would change
naturally given our rotation of scrum masters, but generally being more forward would help as well on my part(A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As I had been sick this week, I had sadly not been able to make any deliveries on paper. I did however help
out whenever my team needed help in regards to css, html and C# while also giving tip to being more structured.(A)
I hope to make some deliveries next week(B), which should come naturally given I hopefully am not sick at that time :) (A->B)
