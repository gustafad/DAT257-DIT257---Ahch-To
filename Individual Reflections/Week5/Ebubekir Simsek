Week 5
What do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently, I feel that I have achieved my goals from last week(A). This week I want to learn more about how to sort a big list of Vehicles in the 
most effective way in C# in order to make the website faster (B). 
I will search for more information and perhaps watch videos about how to sort a list in the “best” way for our situation(A->B).

Another thing I want to learn better is to properly estimate time on our user stories. It can be hard to make a good estimation sometimes regarding our work.  

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We are slowly but surely getting a vibe of a done product (A). I could always contribute with my experience desigwice since I have previous knowledge about 
how to make a design better(B). The only way I can think of helping the team is by sharing my experience and the resources I have about the particular topic that is actual(A->B).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week, we got the order from our supervisor to change specifically some of our user stories thus all of them were written a little bit differently 
from each other. The main idea here is to make them all written from the same point of view.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Since I Adam worked together last week, regardless how challenging it felt, we learned a lot from each other. 
In this sprint we worked on one of the user stories where we were supposed to sort the vehicles by the CO2 emission. This time, 
it went much better with the estimation time than last week.
