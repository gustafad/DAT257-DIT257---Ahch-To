What do I want to learn or understand better?
Looking back at last weeks reflection, my wish to understand html better is only 
slightly fulfilled, as I worked a lot with C# coding this sprint. This however
was a lot of fun and very developing for me. Also my grasp of git has not improved 
as much as i wished(A). Git is still the area I would like to understand better, 
and also broaden my knowledge about C# coding(B).Hopefully next sprint I will get 
to work more with the list filtering function(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week I restructured the modeling part of our application quite a bit, hopefully
to the better. My hopes is that it’s easier to understand now, and easier to expand 
to new functionalities. (A). I hope to bring this new structures benefits to the aid 
of the whole team(B) Next sprint I believe we will be closing up the project and do 
the finishing touches (A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I made good progress by completing my user story. The communication was pretty good 
at the start of the week, but I lagged behind at the end since I got caught up in 
other projects (A). Once again, I believe our work effort needs to be more closely 
interwoven next sprint(B). Next week I am Scrum master and I will do my best to make 
this happen(A->B). 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I restructured the model for the result list of the application. Allowing for filtering
on one variable, and preparing for expanding the filter and sorting functionality in the 
coming sprints(A). Since sorting and filtering is one of the central ideas for the project, 
I hope that we will complete this aspect next sprint(B). My suggestion next sprint will be 
to focus on this(A->B).
