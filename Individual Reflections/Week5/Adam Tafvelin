Week 5
What do I want to learn or understand better?
In general I believe my goals for last reflection have been reached as we have changed
some userstories estimated time that was more accurate.(A) I wish to continue going
along this track and learn more in general(B)(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As we are closing in on a MVP already, we all have a common mindset of how the product
is aiming to become (Of course some deviation)(A). Due to this all help most are able
to provide is through questions about the code which I find nice as it seems all are
mostly on the same page, this I wish to continue(B). Clear communication should suffice
(A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week I was scrum master. I personally believe I have done a decent job. Though
given how it all has gone quite smoothly, nothing remarkably special was really done(A).
I generally just wish to be a useful member of the team(B) of which I believe I am if I
continue as I have done.(A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week me and Ebu did a restructure of the list along with the sorting of all the 
entries. This later Christoffer improved along with his contribution of delivery. (A)
I wish to continue to contribute to the deliveries as I have done so far.(B) This should
naturally be acomplised as we start next week(A->B)
