What do I want to learn or understand better?
I do have a better understanding of the project and I can start to wrap my head around the project as a whole. I’ve met my teammates a 
couple more times, and we grinded out some nice ideas(A).
We’ve still got a long way to go. I would like to get more familiar with the development  workspace. I’ve never created a web-application 
before, so I want and need to learn that better(B).
Next week we will start developing for real so this should bring some clarity to the situation(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We’re still focusing mostly on the project and how it should be done, so I’m not sure about in which ways we are complementing each other 
yet(A), we’re still getting to know eatchother. I hope that my coding skills are up for the task and that I can contribute with some neat 
tricks along the way(B).
Once again this will reveal itself during the following weeks :) (A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have a somewhat greater understanding about Scrum philosophy than before, but I hope to learn it even better. We’re just past the 
brainstorming phase and have started to settle on a more solid idea(A). We need to make a plan, select a scrum-master and distribute tasks 
between us(B), all this planning will happen next week I’m sure(A->B). 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
So far almost everything has happened in a group setting. Brainstorming for the initial idea and laying out the project scope has been a group 
activity where i feel we’ve all been actively contributing(A). Once again, i believe that we will be able to make much more progress on the 
actual application next week(B). I mean hey, we’re having team-meetings every Monday & Friday!(A->B)
