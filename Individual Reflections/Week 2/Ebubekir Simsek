What do I want to learn or understand better?
This time I have more material to reflect over thus we are at the end of the second week of this course (A), 
at the moment I believe that I have the basic understanding of how the methodology Scrum is supposed to work. 
But still we haven’t started working on our project separately. 
Since we decided to work on a web application, I felt that I needed to focus more on researching web applications, CSS,HTML and javascript in order to do repetition on my knowledge in this area. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We haven't faced big difficulties yet as a group or separately ourselves. 
If I have the opportunity and the knowledge to help someone or the entire team that has a problem(A), I would try to solve the case and help them out (B). 
That can be achieved easily by being open for discussion, sharing my experiences, my ideas and knowledge about the case(A->B).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
It's hard to answer since we haven't begun our first sprint yet(A).
We should always strive for a Scrum that works properly for the group and separately works as well(B). 
By respecting the rules of which Scrum provides (A ->B) I believe that we would see more advantages during our work process.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
So far, I personally think that the deliveries we have done as a group are quite good(A). 
I have always tried to be available for our meetings and work sessions as well. 
I believe that I have taken my responsibility and been active on the team's deliveries along with my team members. 
I can always try to improve myself and my contribution inklusive strive for a better result for the group (A->B).
