What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since I’m so new to html, this week too has been a big leap in my understanding of it! 
Also I’m learning more about Visual Studio as an IDE every day (A). This needs to develop 
even further, and especially git and all its kinks. Git has been a real struggle for me 
and the whole team this week(B). I think we will develop a better standardized way to use 
git next week, to make things easier for all of us. (A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I managed to get some understanding about designing html in an MVC architecture this week, 
and i tried to propagate my newfound skills to the team during the meetings(A).Still, the 
challenges with git, i have som insight, that i want to develop further and share with the 
team(B) I will research more and find a good structure to use next week. (A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week I felt more active, and I worked a lot on my user stories. We collaboratively 
wrote the team reflection(A). Maybe we should try to work even closer next week, communicating 
more as we go through the week(B). I will suggest this at next week's startup meeting(A->B). 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I redesigned the whole page, and rebuilt the design structure to one centralized css file (A). 
We will see what user story I take on next week(B). This will be decided at the Monday meeting(A->B).
