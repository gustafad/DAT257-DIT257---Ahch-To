What do I want to learn or understand better?
The way of working with scrum seems to be engraved into my mind more now, I belive I have reached my wishes from
the last reflection(A) I wish to learn more to properly estimate time and how long a user story will take(B)
This might be possible to do if more user stories are added or devided.(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I had been working together with Ebu during this sprint, we had tought eachother during the progress and I hope
that I was able to help him as well. There was also some questions I got from the rest of the team that I also
answered(A). I wish to continue this trend(B) by continuing being helpful(A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Again me being a general memeber of scrum this week, I did what was planned regarding scrum and it worked well(A)
There is nothing specific that I wish to change for this part that I have not already bringed up(B)(A->B)

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As I mentioned earlier, I worked together with Ebu on the delivery I did. This was due to how complex that
delivery seemed to be. And complex it was. It took us WAY more time than we expected and we ended up with working
13 hours instead of the 3.33 hours we estimated it to take. In addition to this, we had another delivery planned
for this week, but due to how long the first one took it was impossible for us to do that one as well. Thus
we moved that delivery to next week(A) I do wish that we had estimated better on that task. It was very frustrating
when we had passed 3.33 hours and we felt like we had gone nowhere. (A->B) To do this better I believe that a
better estimation method should be applied, where we more intensly think about what could go wrong and what setbacks
could occur on this user story. And also always assume it will take longer than we think.(A->B)
