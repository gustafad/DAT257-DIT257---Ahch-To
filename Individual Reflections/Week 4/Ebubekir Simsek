What do I want to learn or understand better?
Right now I feel that I have achieved my goals from last week(A). This week, I want to learn more about the scrum master role and how to help the team as a 
scrum master in the best way(B). To achieve the goal, I could always search for more information about how a scrum master behaves and talk with my 
group members about how they want the scrum master to act during the meetings and the work process(A->B). 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Of course we have been in situations where someone in the group needed help(A). 
I would always try to solve the case and help them out (B) and  the only way I can think of helping the team is by sharing my experience and the resources 
I have about the particular topic that is actual(A->B).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week, overall I have tried to figure out more about KPI so that I can help and contribute to the team, 
understand it and use Scrum in a more effective way.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
In this sprint I worked on one of the user stories together with Adam since it was a challenging part to make. 
The user story was about converting API data to variables, and then being able to display it in the resutlfield. 
We needed to make sure it worked as specified in the acceptance criteria and that it matches the Figma design we made in the project scope.
