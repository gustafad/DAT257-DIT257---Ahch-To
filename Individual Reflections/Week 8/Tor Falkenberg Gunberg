What do I want to learn or understand better?
As there was some terminology and information about “signing off” the repo etc. that 
I was uncertain about I wanted to revisit the lecture slides and course information.
And so I did. This cleared up most of the questions I had(A).  
Next week we will write the report and after that I want to learn how to pass my other
exams ;)(B). 
We’re gonna have a long meeting finalizing the report, and after that I will spend all 
of my wake time eating or studying.(A->B)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As we were doing the final touches mostly together as a group this was an excellent 
week to explain certain details of the parts that I did to the rest of the group. 
Mostly about structure and the way (that I like) to build a class or structure(A). 
Next week we’re simly writing report, and we will learn from eachothers thoughts and 
feelings about the project we’ve done(B). 
This will happen naturally while writing the report together(A->B).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Writing team reflection together as usual. Also I refreshed some terminology and read up 
on the specifics of the final report and repo delivery and shared with the group(A). 
Next week it’s all about putting together the final report(B)&(A->B). 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A few design fixes like adjusting text and size. Going over the comments in the code and 
making some changes. And together with the whole team we prepared our presentation, and 
cleaned up the git repository(A). 
Like I mentioned, next week is all about writing the report(B)&(A->B).
