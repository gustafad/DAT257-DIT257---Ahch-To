What do I want to learn or understand better?

We have done the presention and I felt like it went well and I have the same feelnig towards the entire project. For the next project I would like to have
a better understanding of the general structure of everything before hand so it all goes smoothly and everyone is on the right page. This would be achieved
by doing more research from the start.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I feel that what I have provided to the group has been essensial towards the teams success, this goes of course very much for the other team members as well.
Our collective sharing of knowledge and communication has been very beneficial. For the next project I would like to be more concistent with my documentation
in the code as I first did it a little sloppy. This meant that what I wrote was not completly understandable from the start.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

For every week I have been active and tried my best to be a helpful member of the team. For the next project I would like to try a more leading role in the
group as that is something I need to practice on.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

For this week we did not have that many userstories to develop but rather we focused on the presentation and the final report. Of which I wrote part of.
For the next project I would like to develop as a single developer for the userstories to have that under my experience as well.
