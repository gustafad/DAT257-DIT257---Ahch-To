Week 8
What do I want to learn or understand better?
Everything has been very good this week as well, I want to learn more about how to make hand in for the final product of our project. 
For example, write a readme file, git inspect and more that is required. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Due to the fact that we have our final deadline next week, I do not believe that we will meet any hard challenges. 
In case that someone needs help, I will always try to share my experience and the resources I have about the particular topic that is relevant. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been helping make the last checks before we hand in next week. I.e the trello board, the team reflection, 
team retrospective and the final rapport as well.  

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week, we had our presentation for our course teacher and the course participants. 
I helped my team structure our presentation as well as writing in our final rapport.
