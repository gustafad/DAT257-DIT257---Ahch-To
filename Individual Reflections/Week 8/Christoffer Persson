What do I want to learn or understand better?

The presentation went well but I felt a bit lost while constructing it. Next time I would like to gain more of an understanding of the context in which we
are presenting before the occasion. I should accomplish this by either understanding or communicating to increase the situations context.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Writing and commenting on the final report should provide us with a more complete retrospective and goals for future projects as we coagulate ideas and opinions
into the final report. Providing feedback and opinions on my team members writings in the final report should help them increase their understanding of my ideas and 
hopefully provide them with more valuable experience to take into following projects.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I have been active in the planning and review meetings hopefully leading to better deliverables. As stated last week I added rudimentary deliverables into trello
in order for nothing to forgotten or overlooked. These cards created a greater understanding of the goal and security in knowing that nothing has been missed.
This is something I would like to take into future projects and might be best adapted to myself taking notes of tasks to be done each sprint such that my anxiety 
regarding forgotten deliverables may be mitigated.
 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I supplied instructions aquired from supervisors and presentation slides of the presentation to the team. I also wrote a rough draft for the presentation which 
lent itself as a basis as each member tweaked parts to suit their needs. Being proactive in accomplishing deliverables is something that has worked well thorughout
the project and something I would like to take with me into coming ones.
