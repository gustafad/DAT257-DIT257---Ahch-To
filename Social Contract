	- Ask for help (and be helpful) when needed
	- Use the planner (trello?) to clearly communicate what you and others are working on.
	- Don't be scared to PING in discord, some of us regularly use Don't disturb
	- Sprint meetings on Monday and Friday
	- Spend enough and fair amount of time on the project
	- Be honest if you feel someone is lacking in performance or anything else, try to take it as good criticism.
